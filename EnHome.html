    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Kefei Duan, a Ph.D. student in Washington University in St. Louis. My major is Computer Science, and I am a member of WashU NLP group advised by <a href="https://cgraywang.github.io/">Prof. Chenguang Wang.</a></br>
      My research interest includes natural language processing, language models and their application, etc. </br>
      <!-- From my perspective, my interests in these things mainly come from my enthusiasm for computers and robots. It's so exciting to have machines understand human language and knowledge, to communicate and interact with a computer, and to see what knowledge computers can gain from text and language. In my opinion, true artificial intelligence should be intelligence that can understand human language and can gain knowledge from it. This can take a long time to achieve and require many people to put in their efforts. -->

              <p>Current Progress: For now, we have done some preliminary research and conducted some experiments using some baselines. We have implemented a simple model based on our idea, but more things need to be done. Due to time constraints, this project was temporarily put on hold. We will start working on this project again afterwards and it will become my thesis topic.</p>
